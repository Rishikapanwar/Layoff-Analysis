# Layoffs Data Cleaning and Analysis using SQL

# Overview
This project involves cleaning and analysing a layoff dataset covering multiple industries, locations, and periods using SQL and presenting the insights as a Power BI dashboard. I took up this project to revise some SQL concepts like CTEs and try out Power BI.

# Data cleaning steps:
1. Handling duplicates: Identified and removed 2,915 duplicate entries across the dataset
2. Standardising data
3. Handling null values: Mainly removed records where both, total_laid_off and percentage_laid_off, were NULL since it doesn't give much insights
